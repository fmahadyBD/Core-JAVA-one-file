# Inner class

It  means class inside the class
In Java, it is also possible to nest classes (a class within a class). The purpose of nested classes is 
to group classes that belong together, which makes your code more readable and maintainable.

To access the inner class, create an object of the outer class, and then create an object of the inner class
